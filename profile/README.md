## 🏴‍☠️ Welcome to the Pirate Radio Organization

This organization hosts repositories for modding tools, utilities, and community resources for [`Knockout City - Private Server Edition`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915930/Knockout_City__Private_Server_Edition/).

I do **not** host the game itself. The `Knockout City - Private Server Edition` is available directly on [`Steam`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915930/Knockout_City__Private_Server_Edition/). The projects are focused on providing tools to help you mod the game or provide tooling to interact with the game on some way.

**Please note**: This is a passion project of mine I pour a lot of work into in my free time. Besides that I am still human so progress on this topic might not be as fast as you might hope. I still try my best to improve on the tooling as best as I can.

### A Note on closed-source Tooling

You will notice that the main applications are closed-source. This is a deliberate choice to protect the original developers, [**Velan Studios**](https://www.velanstudios.com/).

> Velan Studios still actively uses their custom engine (Viper) for other and future titles. To avoid causing them any harm or accidentally exposing any of their internal specifications to the public, I am keeping the primary tools closed-source.
> 
> I am fully aware that this will slow down development of new things dramatically but currently I have not found a way to protect Velan Studios and allow for contribution by others. This might change in the future but can't promise anything for certain.
>
> I appreciate your understanding.
